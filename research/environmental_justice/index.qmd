Effective climate solutions are ones that prioritize the safety and resilience of everyone, particularly frontline communities. Some questions I am particularly interested in: 

-   What factors are most important for successful governmental and non-governmental partnerships?

-   Which collaborative governance processes meaningfully involve and benefit frontline communities?

-   How can collaborative adpaption efforts be scaled up while meeting community- and place-specific needs?
