Science governance includes the people, organizations, collaborative forums, and rules/laws that organize how science is done and incorporated into decision-making. My research in this area primarily focuses on the science enterprise of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, a well-developed governance arrangement of science forums and actors, that supports the implementation of adaptive management of the Delta. Some of my research questions include:

-   What aspects of collaborative science forums are most important for learning?

-   How can monitoring better align with management needs?

-   Has collaboration spurred agreement on different issues?
