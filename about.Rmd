My name is Tara Pozzi! I am a PhD student in the Graduate Group of Ecology at UC Davis. My research focuses on behavior and decision-making processes that influence local and regional adaptive capacity and resilience to climate impacts. I come from an interdisciplinary background in engineering, ecological science, and social science.
