My research investigates how to build capacity for effective and equitable climate adaptation solutions. As a mixed-methods social scientist, I conduct studies that use both qualitative such as interviews and focus groups, and quantitative methodologies such as social network analysis and Bayesian statistics. I pull from these different methods to focus on building capacity through **climate change education, policy learning, and collaborative governance**.

#### Learning from science forum participation 

#### *Collaborative governance of climate adaptation*
