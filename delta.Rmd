As the main source of water supply for two-thirds of California, a unique biodiversity hot spot, and home to many communities, the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta is known as the *heart* of California. Impacted by flooding, water shortage, extreme heat, and wildfire, my research explores how human communities in the Delta are adapting to climate change and how to build capacity to address intersectional social and phsyical vulnerabilities that Delta residents face.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Research questions**

My research project asks three main questions:

1.  How are Delta communities adapting to climate change?
2.  What is the structure (e.g., organizations, coalitions, forums) of the adaptation governance network in the Delta?
3.  What partnerships models have been effective in adaptation planning successes (e.g., receiving grant funding, implementing a project, developing a Climate Adaptation Plan)?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Research products**

-   Publicly-available website with a map of the adaptation governance network for the Delta and key survey results

-   Report on current adaptation efforts, governance challenges/successes for adaptation planning, collaborative forums, and recommendations to support partnered adaptation efforts

-   Video presentation of main research findings

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Project timeline**

January - March 2023:

-   Develop research design and interview question protocol

April 2023 - August 2023:

-   Conduct interviews with individuals involved in adaptation in the Delta

-   Develop preliminary findings for governance successes/challenges, partnership models, and network

-   Create inventory of adaptation efforts in the Delta and adaptation governance network based on information available online

September 2023 - December 2023:

-   Create online survey to gather quantitative measures of interview findings

-   Distribute survey to individuals who may be involved in adaptation in the Delta

January 2024 - March 2024:

-   Share a report with key findings from the interviews

-   Analyze survey data

April 2024 - August 2024:

-   Publish online resource that will house a map of the adaptation governance network, descriptive plots of the survey results, and a page to provide feedback on results

-   Produce a report summarizing the survey results and key takeaways

-   Produce shareable video presentation of results
