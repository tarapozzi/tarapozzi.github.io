Hello! I am the CA Sea Grant Social Science Extension Specialist for the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. My research and extension program focuses on interorganizational collaboration in the Delta, tradeoffs/opportunities for adaptation strategies, and community resilience. I recently graduated with my PhD in Ecology from UC Davis and was a 2022 Delta Science Fellow. Check out my website to learning more about my work priorities.
