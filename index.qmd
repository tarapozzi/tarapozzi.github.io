Hello! I am a PhD candidate in the Graduate Group of Ecology and Center for Environmental Policy and Behavior at UC Davis, as well as a Delta Science Fellow. Prior to my time at UC Davis, I completed my masters at Boise State University in Human-Environment Systems studying technology adoption for flood risk management in the Pacific Northwest.

My research investigates the governance of climate adaptation planning and policy. Check out my research page for specific information on my current projects!
