Hello! I am a social scientist curious about what effective environmental governance look like. I use my interdisciplinary training in water resource engineering and social-ecological systems science to investigate water and natural resource management challenges. I am currently a PhD candidate in the Graduate Group of Ecology and Center for Environmental Policy and Behavior at UC Davis, as well as a Delta Science Fellow. Check out my website to learning more about my research and teaching!
