Hello! I am a PhD student in the Graduate Group of Ecology and Center for Environmental Policy and Behavior at UC Davis, as well as a Delta Science Fellow. Prior to my time at UC Davis, I completed my masters at Boise State University in Human-Environment Systems studying technology adoption for flood risk management in the Pacific Northwest.

My research investigates how to build capacity for effective and equitable climate adaptation solutions. As a mixed-methods social scientist, I conduct studies that gather qualitative data from interviews and focus groups, as well as quanitative data from surveys and online data respositories. I pull from Social Network Analysis and Bayesian statistics to analyze the data. I pull from these different methods to investigate three main research streams: **collaborative governance, policy learning, and policy learning**. I am currently updating my website my research projects in each of these topic areas. Please check out my research (research.html) page for specific information on my current projects. 

I also am passionate about making R approachable to graduate students and help lead our Davis - R Users' Group at UC Davis and teach R - DAVIS, an introductory course on R programming.
