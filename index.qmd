Hello! I am a social scientist trying to understand what effective climate solutions look like. I take an interdisciplinary to my research that draws from environental governance, policy process theory, and ecology. I am currently a PhD candidate in the Graduate Group of Ecology and Center for Environmental Policy and Behavior at UC Davis, as well as a Delta Science Fellow.
