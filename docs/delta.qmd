As the main source of water supply for two-thirds of California, a unique biodiversity hot spot, and home to many communities, the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta is known as the *heart* of California. Impacted by flooding, water shortage, extreme heat, and wildfire, my research explores how human communities in the Delta are adapting to climate vulnerabilities and how they can leverage and build their partnerships to build social, technical, and financial capital.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Research questions**

My research project asks three main questions:

1.  How are Delta communities adapting to climate change?
2.  What is the structure (e.g., organizations, coalitions, forums) of the adaptation governance network in the Delta?
3.  What partnerships models have been effective in adaptation planning successes (e.g., receiving grant funding, implementing a project, developing a Climate Adaptation Plan)?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Research products**

-   Report based on interview findings about governance challenges/successes for adaptation planning, major collaborative forums, and recommendations to support partnered adaptation efforts

-   Report based on survey findings with a supplementary website that will host a map of the adaptation governance network for the Delta and key survey results

-   Video presentation of main interview and survey findings
