These networks, shaped by relationships between EJ groups and their partners, shape the effectiveness of an EJ movement to influence environmental policy and decision-making. Drawing from social movement literature, we examine how resource exchange motivations and boundary definition drivers affect EJ groups’ partner preferences among EJ groups in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta region of California. Using network data from 21 EJ groups gathered through interviews, we implement a cross-classified generalized linear mixed model to estimate the effects of organizational attributes and collaborative participation, EJ commitment and issue focus areas, and geography on the likelihood of collaboration ties in egocentric social networks. Overall, we find evidence of both strong and weak ties occurring in partner selection. EJ groups seek partners with shared issue focus areas as well as broker organizations who participate in collaborative initiatives. Geographic proximity also plays a key role with groups preferring local partners mostly, but also finding value in partners that operate at larger geographic scales. Overall, the study provides evidence that EJ groups strategically structure personal networks to leverage resources, address issues of concern, and ultimately strengthen the EJ movement.\nOutputs:\nPozzi, T., Lubell, M., and Rudnick, J.

[In Prep]\n\n\n\nLearning in the Delta Science Enterprise\nAbstract: Science is critical for learning and adaptation of policy and governance systems. Increasingly, science is produced in the context of a science enterprise: a complex, polycentric institutional arrangement featuring multiple science forums and actors. The characteristics of these polycentric systems likely matter for whether and to what extent science supports policy-relevant learning. Limited research, however, has examined how science enterprises function as polycentric systems and how they can be governed to support learning. Using a survey of actors involved in the science enterprise of the California Delta, we integrate the collective learning framework and ecology of games framework to analyze individual and forum-level drivers of learning. The results suggest that social drivers such as leadership, trust, and engagement that are most highly correlated with perceived learning. While science enterprise actors often perceive administrative and financial resource limitations, those constraints are less important for learning than social drivers.\nOutputs:\nLubell, M., Pozzi, T., Heikkila, T., and Gerlak, A.

We developed a transformative climate change education program called Asking Different Questions in Climate Change Science that focuses on equity. This program is guided by a theory of change we developed based on a diverse body of literature and empirical examples, as well as qualitative data from 20 UC Davis faculty and students. Through the investigation, we found that individual characteristics such as motivations, lived experiences, and academic background, as well as contextual characteristics such as an individual’s social, cultural, and institutional environments of support, impact an individual’s experience with doing equity-focused research and practices. We argue that the integration of equity in climate change education can give graduate students the skills, knowledge, and resources to understand and respond to climate change problems more effectively.\nOutputs:\nPozzi, T., Legg, E., McCullough, S., & Lubell, M.

    "text": "Project Team\nTara Pozzi1, Dr. Mark Lubell1, Lindsay Correa2\n1Center for Environmental Policy and Behavior, UC Davis, CA\n2California Department of Water Resources, Sacramento, CA\n\n\n\nProject Overview\n\nThe Delta region faces numerous challenges, including flooding, extreme heat, and poor air and water quality. Addressing these issues requires collaboration among a complex network of government agencies, non-governmental organizations, communities, and Tribes.\nTo better understand and improve the governance of this complex system, we are mapping the network of organizations and collaborative initiatives involved in planning and implementing adaptation strategies. By creating this baseline understanding, we can identify how the network is functioning and where it may be falling short.\nOur research methodology involves:\n\nConducting interviews with a subset of adaptation practitioners to gain in-depth knowledge of key governance players and needs\nDistributing an online survey to the broader Delta adaptation community to understand policy preferences and collaborative experiences\n\nThis data will provide a comprehensive synthesis of the adaptation governance landscape. Some of the anticipated benefits of this research include:\n\nPractitioners will be able to visualize their position within the network, potentially discover new collaborators, and understand how to participate more strategically\nGovernment agencies will gain insights into the most effective engagement strategies and learn how to target investments to benefit rural and marginalized communities\n\nUnderstanding the governance landscape is a key step in learning how to leverage partnerships for positive social and environmental change and investing in more effective climate adaptation strategies. \n\n\n\nMain Research Questions\n\nWho is involved in climate adaptation and what are they doing?\nWhat are the top governance challenges and preferred adaptation strategies?\nWhat is the structure of the adaptation governance network and how well is it functioning? How does this vary across urban and rural land use contexts?\n\n\n\n\nResearch Products\n2024 State of the Estuary Poster\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming Research Products\n\nReport based on interview and survey findings about governance challenges/successes for adaptation planning, major collaborative forums, and recommendations to support partnered adaptation efforts\nVideo presentation of main interview and survey findings\n\n\nMore information:\nDelta Science Tracker\nDelta Science Fellows Factsheet"
