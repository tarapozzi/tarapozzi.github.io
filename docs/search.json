    "text": "Collaborative governance of climate adaptation in the Delta\nAs the main source of water supply for two-thirds of California, a unique biodiversity hot spot, and home to many communities, the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta is known as the heart of California. Impacted by flooding, water shortage, extreme heat, and wildfire, my research explores how human communities in the Delta are adapting to climate vulnerabilities and how they can leverage and build their partnerships to build social, technical, and financial capital. The research combines interview and survey data and will be used to develop a governance challenges report, a network map of organizations and their partnerships, and an interactive website of the results.

We developed a transformative climate change education program called Asking Different Questions in Climate Change Science that focuses on equity. This program is guided by a theory of change we developed based on a diverse body of literature and empirical examples, as well as qualitative data from 20 UC Davis faculty and students. Through the investigation, we found that individual characteristics such as motivations, lived experiences, and academic background, as well as contextual characteristics such as an individual’s social, cultural, and institutional environments of support, impact an individual’s experience with doing equity-focused research and practices. We argue that the integration of equity in climate change education can give graduate students the skills, knowledge, and resources to understand and respond to climate change problems more effectively.\nOutputs:\nPozzi, T., Legg, E., McCullough, S., & Lubell, M.

Increasingly, science is produced in the context of a science enterprise: a complex, polycentric institutional arrangement featuring multiple science forums and actors. The characteristics of these polycentric systems likely matter for whether and to what extent science supports policy-relevant learning. Limited research, however, has examined how science enterprises function as polycentric systems and how they can be governed to support learning. Using a survey of actors involved in the science enterprise of the California Delta, we integrate the collective learning framework and ecology of games framework to analyze individual and forum-level drivers of learning. The results suggest that social drivers such as leadership, trust, and engagement that are most highly correlated with perceived learning. While science enterprise actors often perceive administrative and financial resource limitations, those constraints are less important for learning than social drivers.\nOutputs:\nLubell, M., Pozzi, T., Heikkila, T., and Gerlak, A.

    "text": "Hello! I am a PhD student in the Graduate Group of Ecology and Center for Environmental Policy and Behavior at UC Davis, as well as a Delta Science Fellow. Prior to my time at UC Davis, I completed my masters at Boise State University in Human-Environment Systems studying technology adoption for flood risk management in the Pacific Northwest.\nMy research investigates how to build capacity for effective and equitable climate adaptation solutions. As a mixed-methods social scientist, I conduct studies that gather qualitative data from interviews and focus groups, as well as quanitative data from surveys and online data respositories. I primarily use Social Network Analysis and Bayesian statistics to analyze these data. I pull from these different methods to investigate research questions in collaborative governance and policy process. Please check out my research page for specific information on my current projects.\nI also am passionate about making R approachable to graduate students and help lead our Davis - R Users’ Group at UC Davis and teach R - DAVIS, an introductory course on R programming."
