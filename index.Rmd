Hello! I am a PhD student in the Graduate Group of Ecology and Center for Environmental Policy and Behavior at UC Davis, as well as a Delta Science Fellow. My research focuses on behavior and decision-making processes that influence local and regional adaptive capacity and resilience to climate impacts. Prior to my time at UC Davis, I completed my masters at Boise State University in Human-Environment Systems studying technology adoption for flood risk management in the Pacific Northwest.

My interest climate adaptation stems from growing up in the Salinas Valley. I saw from a young age the benefits of collaboration to navigate environmental uncertainty and have been inspired in how to scale-up strategic collaboration to navigate physical vulnerability from increased variability of water resources. I also am an advocate for those with visible and invisible disabilities that are disproportionately impacted by climate change. My research focus aligns both my social and environmental vulnerability interests to improve meaningful engagement of impacted individuals.
